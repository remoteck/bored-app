Are you bored? Try using my app now!

### General Overview of the Features
1. Generate completely random activity suggestions.
2. Set a constraint to the type/category of activities you want to be suggested.
3. Mark an acivity as favourite and access it later in the favourites tab.
4. You can even swipe to delete the favourites.


### How does it work?

The app sends api requests to [BoredAPI](www.boredapi.com).
Depending on the url that I send, it gives me back an appropriate data which I then display on my app.
